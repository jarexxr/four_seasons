    <h1>Summer</h1>

    <h2>Likes</h2>
    <p>One the best thing about summer is the long days. It feels good to know that the sun doesn't set until
        8:30pm. The freedom to enjoy the outdoors, spending time with friends and family doing a backyard BBQ.
        Driving with your window down is great feeling. Everything feels more alive.</p>

    <h2>Dislikes</h2>
    <p>I hate it when there a heat wave coming in. It's hard to anything outside when the sun is beating down on you.
        Bugs are the absolute worse. Waking up the next day after enjoying outdoor BBQ only to find out my leg been
        bitten by mosquitos a few times. Sleeping is near impossible if don't have anything to cool your room.

    <h1>Autumn</h1>

    <h2>Likes</h2>
    <p>Autumn is a season that many people enjoy because it brings cooler weather and a calm, comfy atmosphere after the
        hot summer. The changing colors of the leaves make the environment very beautiful, and wearing
        sweaters and hoodies adds to the comfort of the season. Autumn is also loved for its holidays and
        relaxing evenings.</p>

    <h2>Dislikes</h2>
    <p>However, the season also has its downsides, such as shorter days, colder mornings, and frequent rain that can
        feel
        gloomy. For some people, just the thought of the transition into winter makes them feel down. The worst of it is
        when
        you have a lot of trees in your hard. Raking the fallens leaves is not fun. </p>

    <h1>Winter</h1>

    <h2>Likes</h2>
    <p>Even though many people don't like the winter, it certainly has its unique charm. The snowy landscapes, the snow
        that
        build on tree on tree branches is absolutly beautiful. The cold weather makes staying indoors feel cozy,
        especially
        with warm blankets, hot chocolate, and time spent with family during holidays like Christmas and New Year.</p>

    <h2>Dislikes</h2>
    <p>Winter can be difficult because of freezing temperatures, slippery roads, and shorter days that make
        everything feel darker and more tiring. Getting out of bed on cold mornings is hard, and illnesses like colds
        and
        flu are more common. The snow build up makes driving on roads an absolute nightmare.</p>

    <h1>Spring</h1>

    <h2>Likes</h2>
    <p>Spring is a refreshing season that many people enjoy because it represents new beginnings and fresh energy.
        Flowers
        bloom, trees turn green again, and the warmer weather makes it pleasant to spend time outdoors. Spring is also a
        great time for picnics, festivals, and enjoying longer days.</p>

    <h2>Dislikes</h2>
    <p>However, the season has its downsides, including unpredictable weather, sudden rain showers, and allergies caused
        by pollen. Insects also start to appear, which can be annoying. Daylights saving ruining my sleep. </p>
